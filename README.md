📚 Project Overview
Welcome to the Deepfake Detection project! This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning-based system designed to detect deepfake videos. Deepfakes refer to synthetic media in which a person in an existing image or video is replaced with someone else's likeness. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and identify these manipulated media files, ensuring the authenticity of visual content.

✨ Features
🔍 Data Preprocessing: Scripts to clean and preprocess the dataset, including face extraction and alignment.
🧠 Model Training: Implementation of various machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to detect deepfakes.
📊 Evaluation Metrics: Tools to evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
📈 Visualization: Code to visualize training progress, model performance, and detection results.
🚀 Deployment: Instructions and scripts to deploy the trained model for real-time deepfake detection.
