# Deepfake-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Project Overview

Subscribe Welcome to the Deepfake Detection project! A Machine Learning system to detect deepfakes (Deepfake detect) in this repository, What are deepfakes and how do they work? This project helps analyze these manipulated media files using advanced machine learning algorithms, thereby verifying the authenticity of visual content.

Features

Data Preprocessing - Scripts to clean the dataset, sort into folders containing only one person, and compute the faces bounding boxes and landmarks.

After preparing the data, the data issues were fixed, the real faces and deepfake faces were uploaded into the model for implementation done on the 3 machine learning models to detect the deepfakes using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).

Evaluation Metrics: Components used to check the performance of our model through some metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
